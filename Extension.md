# Possible Extensions

The movie_recommender system is just a example (or subset) of the Recommender systems class.

Other examples include song recommender, game recommender, book recommender, online shopping product recommender, job recommender on job searching platforms, etc.

The song, game and book recommenders are very much similar like the movie recommender. They all have a genre (eg., an action game, a soul music or a horror story book),
which we need to group similar objects together.

We can also have additional informations, which can become an essential criteria for grouping like:
- The artist who wrote the song or who sang it.
- The company who made the game.
- The author who wrote the book or the company who published it.

And obviously we need the ratings (and reviews) for getting the users choice and preferences for suggesting him stuffs.

The main aim of almost all kinds of recommender systems is to group objects/stuffs based on the category they belong to; 
notice the user's behaviour and suggest them stuffs accordingly.
